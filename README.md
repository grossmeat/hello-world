# hello-world
My name is grossmeat. I'm mostly looking to get into retroarch, and learning how to configure it to my purposes. I got the system running to suit my needs at the moment, but i'm exploring the github process. This is not only to customize my system furter, but also to learn how to code linux. This is my first foray into linux, so be patient with me if i'm working on something you're interested in the future.
